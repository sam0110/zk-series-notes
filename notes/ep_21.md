# Episode 21 "Introduction to Zero Knoweldge Proofs"

## What is a zero-knowledge proof?

- A field of study within cryptography
- A prover (party 1) can prove to a verifier (party 2) that they know some statement
  - Universal statement (there is a solution)
  - Specific statement (I know a solution to this problem)
- Results in a true/false value
- Reveals zero knowledge to the verifier (does not show solution)
- Demonstrate you know a secret without revealing it

## Examples

- Where's Waldo?
  - Prover proves they have found Waldo without revealing where
    - Get a giant piece of paper and cut out a hole so you cannot see where the book is but they can see Waldo through the hole
    - Or make a copy, cut out Waldo and show the Verifier
    - Verifier knows the prover is telling the truth
  - This is an example of an interactive proof
- Red pill blue pill
  - Prover proves they are not colorblind by demonstrating they know which pill is which color
  - Verifier is colorblind but verifies that prover is not by secretly either switching them or not switching them
  - Process
    - Verifier holds both pills in either hand but does not know which is which
    - Verifier places their hands behind their back so the prover cannot see
    - Verifier chooses to keep the pills in the same hands or switch them
    - Verifier reveals the pills to the prover and asks if they switched the pills
    - If prover answers correctly, they may have been lucky. The verifier can repeat as necessary until they are confident that the prover is not colorblind
    - If the prover answers incorrectly, the verifier knows that the prover is lying
    - Prover never shares which colors the pills are
  - 50/50 chance of guessing the right answer at first but each time this is repeated this probability goes down.
- Sudoku
  - Non-interactive proof
  - To prove ([source](https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~naor/PAPERS/SUDOKU_DEMO/))
    - The<span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);"> prover </span>places three cards on each cell. On filled-in cells of the puzzle he places three cards with the assigned value, faced up (this can be done by the <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">verifier</span> as well). On the rest of the cells the <span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">prover</span> places the cards according to the solution, faced down.
    - For each row, column and subgrid, the <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">verifier</span> chooses (at random) one of the three cards of each cell in the corresponding row/column/subgrid.and makes packets out of the chosen cards. I.e. <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"> he </span>assembles the cards chosen for that row, columns or subgrid.
    - The <span style="color: rgb(204, 102, 0);">prover</span> shuffles each of the 27 packets separately, and hands the shuffled packets to the <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">verifier</span>.
    - The <span style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">verifier</span> turns over all the cards in each packet, and verifies that in each packet all numbers appear.
  - Requires trust that the prover has followed this protocol
    - There are methods to pre-commit to cryptographically ensure that the protocol is followed
  - The face up cards are important to show so that it is the proof for that specific puzzle
  - In the 80s a method developed to turn interactive proofs into non-interactive proofs
    - Secure hash function to generate "randomness" and create challenges on your side that you then publish and others can verify

## ZK Uses

- Outside of blockchain
  - Some authentication systems use it since you only give up 1 bit of information
  - Prove that you have the private key of a public key
- ZCash
  - Has zero knowledge proofs baked into the protocol itself
- SNARK / STARK
  - Libraries
    - C++ `libsnark`

## 3 properites of a zero-knowledge proof

- Soundness
  - If statement is false, no cheating prover can convince an honest verifier that it is true (exp with small probability)
  - Only if it is true will I be able to prove it
- Completeness
  - If the statement is true then an honest verifier would only be convinced by an honest prover
  - Only if I have the knowledge will I be able to prove it
- Zero-knowledge-ness
  - If statement is true, no verifier learns any other fact than the statement is true
  - Only gives 1 bit of information and no more
  - Interactive proofs involve 2 parties communicating
    - Challenge-response mechanism
  - Non-interactive proofs allow you to publish the proof and anyone could verify
    - Generate challenges and reply with all responses at onces
    - Verifier can then verify them all on their own

## Extra

- A challenge-response mechanism is required in all zero knowledge proofs
- Original concept comes from MIT researchers in 1985
- ZK proofs are RAM-intensive
